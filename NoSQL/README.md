# NoSQL Basics

## Introduction

This README provides a brief overview of NoSQL databases, including what NoSQL means, the difference between SQL and NoSQL, ACID, document storage, types of NoSQL databases, benefits of NoSQL, querying information, and basic operations in MongoDB.

## What is NoSQL?

NoSQL, which stands for "not only SQL," is a type of database management system that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and retrieving data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not use a fixed schema and are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.

## SQL vs. NoSQL

The main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases lies in their data models and query languages. SQL databases use a structured query language (SQL) and have a predefined schema, while NoSQL databases use various data models (e.g., key-value, document, columnar, graph) and have a flexible schema.

## ACID

ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. While ACID compliance is a fundamental requirement for SQL databases, not all NoSQL databases provide full ACID guarantees.

## Document Storage

In NoSQL databases, document storage is a common data model where data is stored in flexible, semi-structured documents (e.g., JSON, BSON). Each document can have its own structure, allowing for easy scalability and schema evolution.

## Types of NoSQL Databases

There are several types of NoSQL databases, including:

1. Key-Value Stores: These databases store data as a collection of key-value pairs, providing fast and simple data access.
2. Document Databases: These databases store data in flexible, self-describing documents, allowing for easy schema evolution.
3. Columnar Databases: These databases store data in columns rather than rows, making them suitable for analytical workloads.
4. Graph Databases: These databases store data in nodes and edges, enabling efficient traversal of complex relationships.

## Benefits of NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases offer several benefits, including:

- Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of data and can scale horizontally across multiple servers.
- Flexibility: NoSQL databases allow for schema-less data models, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements.
- Performance: NoSQL databases can provide high performance for read and write operations, especially in distributed environments.
- Availability: NoSQL databases often provide built-in replication and fault-tolerance mechanisms, ensuring high availability.

## Querying Information in NoSQL Databases

Querying information in NoSQL databases depends on the specific database and data model being used. Each NoSQL database provides its own query language or API for retrieving data. For example, MongoDB uses a flexible query language called MongoDB Query Language (MQL) to retrieve data from its document database.

## Basic Operations in MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses a document data model. Here are some basic operations in MongoDB:

- Inserting Data: Use the `insertOne()` or `insertMany()` methods to insert data into a collection.
- Updating Data: Use the `updateOne()` or `updateMany()` methods to update existing documents in a collection.
- Deleting Data: Use the `deleteOne()` or `deleteMany()` methods to remove documents from a collection.
- Querying Data: Use the `find()` method to query data based on specific criteria.

For more detailed information on using MongoDB, refer to the official MongoDB documentation.
